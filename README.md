It is a hardware-based project created by mounting a Sense HAT on a Raspberry Pi 4.

The room temperature captured by the Sense HAT is compared with the normal room temperature value using a Python program, which then decides whether the temperature is normal or high.

The temperature value, along with its status, will be displayed on the LED matrix display.
